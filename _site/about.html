## About Me

Hi! I'm Aditi Srinivas and i'm extremely passionate about computer science! I'm currently pursuing my B.Tech degree in Computer Science and Engineering at PES University. I hope to contribute something substantial to the field someday.

I'm an avid reader when I get time to read (haha). Travelling is definitely one of my most favourite things to do and singing has been a part of my life since I was about the age of 5. Not really a sports person but I do enjoy watching cricket (occasionally).

I enjoy the company of dogs more than i do humans. I absolutely cannot wait to be the proud owner of a little woofer someday!

Head on down if you want to know about more about my interests and skills in CS!
